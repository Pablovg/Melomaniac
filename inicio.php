            <h1>Chris Martin and Katy Perry in talks to join American Idol</h1>
            <p>Chris Martin and Katy Perry are in talks to become judges on American Idol.</p>
            <p>The singing competition was axed by Fox last year (16), but is being revived by rival network ABC, who hope to screen the new show next year (18).</p>
            <p>Coldplay frontman Chris was in negotiations as soon as the new series of American Idol was approved, and it's hoped he will be confirmed as a new judge in the coming weeks, according to U.K. newspaper the Daily Mirror.</p>
            <p>The 40-year-old has appeared on talent shows in the past, performing with Coldplay at The X Factor U.K. live finals in 2011 and 2015, and also served as an adviser on the U.S. version of The Voice in 2014.</p>

            <h1>Paul McCartney a pirate in Pirates of the Caribbean</h1>
            <p>Paul McCartney returns to the movie theater on Friday, May 26 as a pirate in Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales.</p>
            <p>McCartney has a small part, listed only as “Jail Guard 2”, so it sounds like it could be a look-quick-or-you’ll-miss-him situation. “Jail Guard 1” is being played by James ‘Jimmy Love’ Lawson whose only other credit is that of a swarm soldier in Star Trek Beyond.</p>
            <p>McCartney’s acting resume is also a little slim. Outside of the various Beatles films, he played “Paul” in Give My Regards to Broad Street and had small parts in Eat the Rich and, on TV, small parts in the likes of The Simpsons, 30 Rock and BoJack Horseman.</p>
            <p>Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales is out in two weeks with returning stars Johnny Depp, Keira Knightly, Geoffrey Rush and Orlando Bloom plus Kaya Scodelario and Javier Bardem.</p>
